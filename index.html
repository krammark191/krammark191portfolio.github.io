                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm a passionate software developer with a focus on creating intuitive and efficient solutions.
                     With expertise in multiple programming languages and frameworks, I enjoy tackling complex problems
                      and turning them into user-friendly applications. I have more experience in backend development,
                       specifically with C++, which the language the majority of my projects use. I also have a keen interest
                        in mobile development, particularly with Flutter and Dart. I also have projects that I have built in the
                         iOS development environment using Swift, and I have also built a basic Android app using Kotlin.

                                    I worked with another software developer, Taden Marston, in pair programming to implement this
                                    project. We built it as part of our C++ course, focusing on encapsulation and design principles.
                                    We started with basic physics classes as the core of the simulation, and further simulations, such
                                    as the position, velocity, and acceleration classes. Once those classes were built and thoroughly tested,
                                    we tied them together with a callback function that draws a lunar lander and updates its position and angle
                                    based on the physics calculations. The project was a great learning experience in applying object-oriented
                                    design principles and encapsulation in C++.

                                    The project also includes a comprehensive set of unit tests to ensure the correctness of the
                                    simulation logic and interactions between objects. This project was a great opportunity to apply
                                    our knowledge of inheritance and encapsulation in a practical context, demonstrating the power
                                    of object-oriented design in creating complex systems.

                                    This project was a fun personal project that I developed over a weekend with the goal of borrowing an existing
                                    translation API and creating an iOS app in order to gain mobile development experience. It started with a simple
                                    interface that allowed users to input text and receive the IPA translation. I used the IPA Translation API to handle
                                    the translation logic, which provided accurate and reliable results. The app features a clean and intuitive
                                    user interface, allowing users to easily input text and view the IPA translation. There is an ability to translate
                                    from a handful of languages, including English, French, Spanish, and German. It is important to note that this app is
                                    not listed on the App Store, as the API was borrowed from an existing webstie and permission was not obtained for
                                    commercial use. However, it serves as a great example of my ability to develop mobile applications and work with
                                    third-party APIs.
