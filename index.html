                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm a passionate software developer with a focus on creating intuitive and efficient solutions.
                    With expertise in multiple programming languages and frameworks, I enjoy tackling complex problems
                    and turning them into user-friendly applications. I have more experience in backend development,
                    specifically with C++, which the language the majority of my projects use. I also have a keen
                    interest
                    in mobile development, particularly with Flutter and Dart. I also have projects that I have built in
                    the
                    iOS development environment using Swift, and I have also built a basic Android app using Kotlin.

                                    This is the crown jewel of my portfolio. This project began in a course designed to
                                    teach us how to combine the
                                    design principles we learned over the course of our college career into a single
                                    software design document (SDD).
                                    For the project we were a class of about 18 students and we organized ourselves into
                                    3 teams of about 3-4 students each,
                                    one team of three students, the chief editor, the chief of tech, and the chief of
                                    QA. Over all the teams was a Project Manager
                                    and an Assistant Project Manager.
                                </p>

                                <p class="project-description secondary-description">
                                    I served the first six weeks as team lead of one of the teams, and the remaining six
                                    weeks as
                                    the Project Manager. I worked closely with the instructor of the course, James
                                    Helfrich, as well as the Assistant PM,
                                    Gary Sibanda, and the chiefs and the team leads to ensure the project was on track
                                    and the SDD was being developed correctly. My
                                    proudest accomplishment as Project Manager was that each of the teams worked
                                    smoothely together and all problems that arose
                                    were resolved quickly and efficiently between the teams, without the need to
                                    escalate to the chiefs or the PM.

                                    The project itself is a rideshare app that allows users to share rides with each
                                    other. It is stemmed from an existing market
                                    in the Rexburg area and a need for a specific app. The course was focused on the
                                    design and development of the SDD, which is
                                    linked below. The app itself is currently in development with Gary and I leading the
                                    development. We currently have two teams,
                                    one for the front-end, which Gary and I are working on with a team of UX designers,
                                    and one for the back-end, which is being led
                                    by one of our colleagues, Evan Riker.

                                    Further development plans include integrating the app with Firebase for user
                                    authentication
                                    and data storage, as well as implementing Google Maps API for route planning and
                                    navigation. The app will also include features
                                    such as ride scheduling, user ratings, and a user-friendly interface. The goal is to
                                    create a fully functional
                                    rideshare app that can be used by students and residents of Rexburg to share rides
                                    and reduce transportation costs.
                                    The app is being developed using Flutter and Dart, which allows for cross-platform
                                    development
                                    and a smooth user experience.

                                    The SDD is a comprehensive document that outlines the architecture, design, and
                                    implementation details of the app.
                                    It includes detailed descriptions of the app's features, user interface design,
                                    database schema, and API endpoints.
                                    The SDD also includes diagrams such as class diagrams, component diagrams, and
                                    dataflow diagrams to illustrate the
                                    app's architecture and design decisions.

                                    The SDD is a living document that will be updated as the project progresses and new

                                    I worked with another software developer, Taden Marston, in pair programming to
                                    implement this
                                    project. We built it as part of our C++ course, focusing on encapsulation and design
                                    principles.
                                    We started with basic physics classes as the core of the simulation, and further
                                    simulations, such
                                    as the position, velocity, and acceleration classes. Once those classes were built
                                    and thoroughly tested,
                                    we tied them together with a callback function that draws a lunar lander and updates

                                    This project, like the Lunar Lander Simulation, was developed as part of a C++

                                    programming with Taden Marston. This project also focuses on encapsulation and
                                    design principles.
                                    The simulation includes a howitzer and projectile classes, which encapsulate the
                                    physics calculations
                                    and rendering logic. The user interface allows for interactive control of the

                                    we reused the same
                                    physics classes from the Lunar Lander project, which allowed us to focus on the

                                    This project was a fun personal project that I developed over a weekend with the
                                    goal of borrowing an existing
                                    translation API and creating an iOS app in order to gain mobile development
                                    experience. It started with a simple
                                    interface that allowed users to input text and receive the IPA translation. I used
                                    the IPA Translation API to handle
                                    the translation logic, which provided accurate and reliable results. The app
                                    features a clean and intuitive
                                    user interface, allowing users to easily input text and view the IPA translation.
                                    There is an ability to translate
                                    from a handful of languages, including English, French, Spanish, and German. It is
                                    important to note that this app is
                                    not listed on the App Store, as the API was borrowed from an existing website and
                                    permission was not obtained for
                                    commercial use. However, it serves as a great example of my ability to develop

                                    third-party APIs.
